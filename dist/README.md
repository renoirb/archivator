# WARNING

This is a stale build output.

At the time of writing, in 2017, the way to bundle was manual.
I was `git commit` the dist folder.
This is it.

Time passed by, work was made, but I haven't reworked build.
Until [v3 rewrite][v3-rewrite], so, this is just to show that it worked.
The code in this folder, and the source are broken and left unfinished.

Use this just as an example of the usability of the initial version.

To see progress of the upcoming release, check out [archivator's v3.x-dev branch][v3-rewrite]

[v3-rewrite]: https://github.com/renoirb/archivator/tree/v3.x-dev
