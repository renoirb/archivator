## CryptoCommonHashingFunctions type

Available Crypto Hashing Functions. Runtime might have a different list though.

Also, this isn't planned to run client-side (in a Web Browser). Maybe the
following list won't work.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type CryptoCommonHashingFunctions =
  | 'sha1'
  | 'sha256'
  | 'md5'
  | 'md5-sha1'
  | 'mdc2'
  | 'sha512'
  | 'sha224'
  | string
```
