## INormalizedAsset.reference property

File name, as a hash and a file extension.

Instead of keeping file name, we are normalizing as a hash + file extension. We
can later-on replace from HTML Document's asset match with this reference
instead.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
reference: string | null
```
